            <p>Hi, my name is Zac Jensen, and I've been intersted in tech 
                for a good period of my life, and I've always aspired to 
                have good skills in tech. I also enjoy the card game Magic
                the Gathering, and I was on the tennis team in high school. 
                I already have some programming knowledge, but I hope Gain
                more skill when it comes to the web and html.
